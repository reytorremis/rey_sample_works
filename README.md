## Data Analyst Projects
---
### Google Colab Projects

***
[Google Data Analyst - Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SEMoFim_BMfPKq8fyGaW6xgIcSrSSUgb#scrollTo=DagP4WgtKWPE)

+ This project utilizes Python visualization and Looker for analyzing bike-share data. The dataset includes over 50 CSV files totaling more than 2GB,     initially loaded into MS SQL Server. After cleaning and transforming the data with SQL, it's extracted to Google Sheets for easy access to Google services. Python and Jupyter Notebook are then used for data visualization. Finally, Looker serves as a dashboard for further data visualization. All files can be found in the google colab.

### Software Development and Programming Projects 

***
[Telegram Bot](https://reytorremis.github.io/rey_sample_works/telegrambot/)

+ The Python code is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, enabling interaction with a MySQL database. It also interfaces with a Telegram Bot and utilizes the Twilio and Mailgun APIs for sending text messages and emails, respectively. Similar to the first project, the server was disabled, but documentation and demonstration remain accessible.
